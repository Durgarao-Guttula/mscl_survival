# RBS Modification: sd6
# Shock Rate: 1.00Hz
# Purpose: Process shock data from 20170316
# This experiment was conducted by shocking E. coli cells in which all seven
# mechanosensitive channel genes were removed from the chromosome. A single
# copy of mscL was introduced into the chromosome with the RBS modification
# sd6. These cells were hypo-osmotically shocked by flowing LB broth
# lacking sodium chloride at a rate of 1.00Hz monitored by the presence of
# and osmo-sensitive dye. Cells were manually marked for survivorship.
# Survivors were defined as those cells which were able to undergo two division
# events after the shock had taken place. Note that this dataset is a special
# case in which there are not marker files for each image. This is because
# a very large majority of the cells died. Entire fields of view died at a time
# and individual markers were not made for expediency.
