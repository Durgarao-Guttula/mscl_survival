{% raw %}<p>Mechanosensitive (MS) channels are transmembrane protein complexes which open and close in response to changes in membrane tension as a result of osmotic shock. Despite extensive biophysical characterization, the contribution of these channels to cell survival remains largely unknown. In this work, we use quantitative video microscopy to measure the abundance of a single species of MS channel in single cells followed by their survival after a large osmotic shock. We observe total death of the population with less than 100 channels per cell and determine that approximately 500 - 700 channels are needed for 80% survival. The number of channels we find to confer nearly full survival is consistent with the counts of the number of channels in wild type cells in several earlier studies. These results prompt further studies to dissect the contribution of other channel species to survival.</p>
