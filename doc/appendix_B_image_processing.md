## IMAGE PROCESSING ##
The experiments presented in this work relied on a combination of quantitative fluorescence microscopy and time-resolved tracking of single cells using video microscopy. Both of these 
The quantitative nature of this work relies on the reliable and unbiased communication between automated and manual image processing. 
To draw a connection between MscL abundance and survival probability under a hypo-osmotic shock, we used a combination of quantitative fluorescence microscopy and video microscopy. This combination presents two challenges.
