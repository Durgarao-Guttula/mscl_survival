## IMAGE PROCESSING ##
To draw a connection between MscL abundance and survival probability under a hypo-osmotic shock, we used a combination of quantitative fluorescence microscopy and video microscopy. This combination presents two challenges.

### Segmentation ##

### Manual Scoring ##

### Fluorescence quantification ##

### Linking fluorescence to survival ###
