## SHINE-DALGARNO SEQUENCE DESIGN

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this work, we examined the influence of a single species of mechanosensitive channel on cell survival when exposed to a large hypo-osmotic shock. Of the seven mehcanosensitive channels in *E. coli*, we chose MscL which is the most well characterized channel and is believed to be the most abundant. To dissect how the probability of survival changes with changing MscL copy number, we a way to control the expression in a manner that would allow direct experiment-to-experiment comparison. Rather than tuning expression through an inducible promoter, as in van den Berg et al., 2016 [@vandenberg2016], we chose to integrate a copy of the *mscL-sfGFP* gene with different Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences. These sequences, generated using the  Salis lab Ribosomal Binding Site strength calculator [@espahborujeni2014; @salis2009], were designed to decrease the expression level relative to the wild-type SD sequence (`SD0`). To further decrease the expression, A-T hairpins of varying length were inserted directly downstream of the SD sequence. A schematic of the SD mutant sequences are shown in [@Fig:sd_design]A. The relative expression level as predicted by the Salis lab calculator is shown in [@Fig:sd_design]B.
