&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most challenging endeavors in the
biological sciences is linking the molecular details of cellular components
to the larger scale physiology of the organism. This formidable task has
perhaps been best met in the context of the central dogma where over half a
century of thorough scientific dissection has left us with some sense of the
connection between the microscopic details and macroscopic consequences
(CITATIONS). This by no means that we are “finished” with the central dogma,
but it serves as a model by which we believe the other enumerable fascinating
phenomena of life should be approached. The wide swath of structural,
biochemical, and mechanical knowledge of mechanosensitive channels makes the
phenomenon of osmoregulation a particularly attractive subject for such
study.

To our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to
quantitatively control the abundance of a single species of
mechanosensitive channel and examine the physiological consequences in
terms of survival probability at single cell resolution. Our results
reveal two notable quantities. First, out of the several hundred single
cell measurements, we never observed a cell which had less than eighty
channels per cell survive an osmotic shock, irrespective of the shock
rate. The second is that between 400 and 500 channels per cell are
needed to provide $\geq 80\%$ survival, depending on the shock rate.

Only recently has the relationship between the MscL copy number and the
probability of survival been approached experimentally. Van den Berg et
al. (2016) examined the contribution of MscL to survival in a genetic
background where all other known mechanosensitive channels had been
deleted from the chromosome and plasmid-borne MscL expression was tuned
through an inducible promoter (7). In this work, they measured the
single-cell channel abundance through super-resolution microscopy and
queried survival through bulk assays. They report a nearly linear
relationship between survival and copy number, with approximately 100
channels per cell conveying 100% survival. While there are subtle
experimental differences between our work (such as control of shock rate
and strength of the osmotic shock) it is very difficult to compare the
two experimental outputs.

In their work, survival was measured through plating assays which
represent the population average rather than the distribution of
survival probability. This provides valuable information regarding the
response of a population to an osmotic shock however the high survival
rate may be due to a wide distribution of channel copies per cell in the
population coupled with aggregation of cells in plating assays which may
result in an under count of the total cell load. The distribution of
MscL channels driven via the native promoter has been examined
previously and has shown to be highly dependent on the carbon source
available as well as the cell density (4). In Van den Berg et al. the
variance of the distribution is exacerbated due to fluctuations in the
gene copy number as the plasmids replicate and are partitioned among
daughter cells upon division. However, our results are in agreement that
in MscL must be present on the order of $10^{2}$ per cell in order to
provide significant protection from hypo-osmotic shock. Furthermore,
both works were performed in a genetic background devoid of all
mechanosensitive channels other than MscL. The role that the other six
known channels play in the larger scheme of dictating cell survival also
remains enigmatic. The level of osmoregulation provided by the other six
mechanosensitive channels and may reduce the total number of MscL
channels required for complete survival in wild-type strains.

A sizeable suite of experimental and theoretical treatment suggests that
only a few copies of MscL should be necessary for 100% protection given
our knowledge of the conductance and the maximal water flux through the
channel in its open state (CITATIONS). The apparent minimum number of
channels required for survival found in this work exceeds the set of
copy numbers estimated from radiolabeling experiments and
electrophysiology, as can be seen in Table 1(11–13, 20). However, more
recent work has utilized the massive technological advances in mass
spectrometry to quantitatively explore the dynamics of bacterial
proteomes. Mining these datasetsfor the MscL protein reveals a channel
abundance between 300 and 600 (Table 1, (14, 16). Another proteomic
approach used ribosomal profiling to estimate protein synthesis rates,
revealing an MscL channel copy number in the range of 500 per cell.
These more recent measurements are in agreement with estimates that
several hundred channels are needed per cell to reliably protect against
osmotic shocks.

The disagreement between the estimates arising from electrophysiology
and mass spectrometry may be a consequence of what the experimental
output is. While mass spectrometry measures the total number of proteins
in a cell population, electrophysiology provides a measure of the number
of active channels. It is possible that the seemingly disparate numbers
are in agreement and provide some information on the regulation of
channel activity. Allostery as a mechanism of molecular regulation is
ubiquitous across biological systems (21), especially in ion channels
and other transmembrane signaling complexes (22). While MscL has no
known allosteric effectors, the gating behavior of mechanosensitive
channels is dependent on the identity of the membrane tension as well as
the identity of the interacting lipids (6, 23) which have been shown to
act as allosteric effectors for some species of ion channels (24). It is
possible that there are unknown allosteric effectors for
mechanosensitive channels, although there is no direct evidence for
gating of MscL by anything other than membrane tension.
