&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most challenging endeavors in the
biological sciences is linking the molecular details of cellular components
to the larger scale physiology of the organism. This formidable task has been
met repeatedly over the past century. For example, the curious 1950
observation of birefringence of anemic red blood cells coupled with their
sickle shape suggested intracellular crystallization. Intense genetic and
biochemical dissection of hemoglobin revealed a single amino acid
substitution lowered the energy barrier for crystallization upon a change in
O$_2$ partial pressure. Another example is the phenomenon of chemosensation
and chemotaxis in bacteria. A physical model for the detection of miniscule
changes in concentration across the length of a single *E. coli* cellwas
first proposed by Howard Berg and XX Purcell in 195XX. A remarkable ability
of this chemosensory system is the ability to sense fold-changes rather than
absolute changes in concentration. This ability to adapt to varying
concentrations of ligand is facilitated by the repeated methylation of the
cytoplasmic domain of the *XXX* receptor. XXx changes to this region leads to
predictable changes in cell physiology. he central dogma has long been a
subject of quantitative dissection where a combination of biochemical
experimentation and biophysical models have given us a picture of how gene
dosage affects furrow positioning in *Drosophila* [Cite gregor], how
recombination of V(D)J gene segments generates an extraordinarily diverse
antibody repertoire [Schatz, Baltimore, GA lovely], and [Something about
translation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This by no means that we are “finished” with any of
these topics. Rather, it's quite the opposite in the sense that we now have a
handle on the biophysical knobs that tune the behavior which opens the door
to a litany of new scientific questions. In the case of mechanosenstaion and
osmorelulation, we have only recently been able to determine some of the
basic facts that allow us to approach this fascinating biological phenomenon
using the tools of physics. The dependence of survival on mechanosensitive
channel abundance is a key quantity that is missing from our toolbox of
facts. To our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to
quantitatively control the abundance of a single species of mechanosensitive
channel and examine the physiological consequences in terms of survival
probability at single cell resolution. Our results reveal two notable
quantities. First, out of the several hundred single cell measurements, we
never observed a cell which had less than eighty channels per cell survive an
osmotic shock, irrespective of the shock rate. The second is that between 400
and 500 channels per cell are needed to provide $\geq 100\%$ survival,
depending on the shock rate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only recently has the relationship between the MscL
copy number and the probability of survival been approached experimentally.
Van den Berg et al. (2016) examined the contribution of MscL to survival in a
genetic background where all other known mechanosensitive channels had been
deleted from the chromosome and plasmid-borne MscL expression was tuned
through an inducible promoter (7). In this work, they measured the
single-cell channel abundance through super-resolution microscopy and queried
survival through bulk assays. They report a nearly linear relationship
between survival and copy number, with approximately 100 channels per cell
conveying 100% survival. While there are subtle experimental differences
between our work (such as control of shock rate and strength of the osmotic
shock) it is very difficult to compare the two experimental outputs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their work, survival was measured through plating
assays which represent the population average rather than the distribution of
survival probability. This provides valuable information regarding the
response of a population to an osmotic shock however the high survival rate
may be due to a wide distribution of channel copies per cell in the
population coupled with aggregation of cells in plating assays which may
result in an under count of the total cell load. The distribution of MscL
channels driven via the native promoter has been examined previously and has
shown to be highly dependent on the carbon source available as well as the
cell density (4). In Van den Berg et al. the variance of the distribution is
exacerbated due to fluctuations in the gene copy number as the plasmids
replicate and are partitioned among daughter cells upon division. However,
our results are in agreement that in MscL must be present on the order of
$10^{2}$ per cell in order to provide significant protection from
hypo-osmotic shock. Furthermore, both works were performed in a genetic
background devoid of all mechanosensitive channels other than MscL. The role
that the other six known channels play in the larger scheme of dictating cell
survival also remains enigmatic. The level of osmoregulation provided by the
other six mechanosensitive channels and may reduce the total number of MscL
channels required for complete survival in wild-type strains.

A sizable suite of experimental and theoretical treatment suggests that only
a few copies of MscL should be necessary for 100% protection given our
knowledge of the conductance and the maximal water flux through the channel
in its open state (CITATIONS). The apparent minimum number of channels
required for survival found in this work exceeds the set of copy numbers
estimated from radiolabeling experiments and electrophysiology, as can be
seen in Table 1(11–13, 20). However, more recent work has utilized the
massive technological advances in mass spectrometry to quantitatively explore
the dynamics of bacterial proteomes. Mining these datasetsfor the MscL
protein reveals a channel abundance between 300 and 600 (Table 1, (14, 16).
Another proteomic approach used ribosomal profiling to estimate protein
synthesis rates, revealing an MscL channel copy number in the range of 500
per cell. These more recent measurements are in agreement with estimates that
several hundred channels are needed per cell to reliably protect against
osmotic shocks.

The disagreement between the estimates arising from electrophysiology and
mass spectrometry may be a consequence of what the experimental output is.
While mass spectrometry measures the total number of proteins in a cell
population, electrophysiology provides a measure of the number of active
channels. It is possible that the seemingly disparate numbers are in
agreement and provide some information on the regulation of channel activity.
Allostery as a mechanism of molecular regulation is ubiquitous across
biological systems (21), especially in ion channels and other transmembrane
signaling complexes (22). While MscL has no known allosteric effectors, the
gating behavior of mechanosensitive channels is dependent on the identity of
the membrane tension as well as the identity of the interacting lipids (6,
23) which have been shown to act as allosteric effectors for some species of
ion channels (24). It is possible that there are unknown allosteric effectors
for mechanosensitive channels, although there is no direct evidence for
gating of MscL by anything other than membrane tension.
